            <p>We're a dedicated team of volunteers passionate about finding loving homes for dogs in Knoxville's animal shelters. Our mission is to raise awareness about the importance of adoption and support local shelters in their efforts to care for and rehome these wonderful animals.</p>
            <p>We believe every dog deserves a second chance, and we're here to help make that happen.</p>
